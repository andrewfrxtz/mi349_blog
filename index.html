      <h1>A Quick Blog!</h1>
      <p>This is a very small blog detailing the two days/sessions I spent building this blog. It's a blog about building the blog. Each post details the two different days that I worked on this project. Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Day One</h3>

        <p>The first day was full of trying to remember how to structure HTML. I watched the review videos to jog my memory, and then went right to work. I thought that starting with the About and Contact pages of the site would be the easiest to tackle, because I would have less to write than the homepage (this one). I did the about page first, since it was very similar to the work we did in the Hello World: Part 1 that we did last week. Adding paragraphs and images were a great start to my initial build of the site. I made great progress, and only had minor changes after that. I did have some validation errors to fix, but it was nothing too complex. I was proud of myself for remembering as much as I did from the week before!</p><br>
        <p>About Me Page:</p><br>
        <p><img alt="Day 1 progress of About Me Page" src="Day 1 About.png" width="300"></p><br>
        <p>After that, I had to tackle the more challenging aspect of this blog - a form. It was a new process that we learned in the lecture materials this week, so I thought it would be best to just push myself through and get it done. I struggled with the syntax a little bit, but the documentation I had available helped me to format it correctly and get all of the options I wanted. After a few more pushes, and a lot of syntax changes and validations, I was able get it where I wanted.</p>
        <p>Contact Me Page:</p><br>
        <p><img alt="Day 1 progress of Contact Page" src="Day 1 Contact.png" width="800"></p><br>
        <p>After getting these pages close to where I wanted them, I decided to take a break. I wanted to make sure I could keep my attention to detail strong while doing the homepage!</p><br>

        <h3>Day Two</h3>
        <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-fritz-920019228/">Andrew Fritz</a></address>
        <time datetime="2023-06-07" title="June 7, 2023">June 7, 2023</time>
        <p>This is the day where I tackled the homepage and the final touches on the pages from the previous day. I needed to review the homepage's requirements, and then build them all out. While I was reviewing the pages and some of the example code from the lecture videos, I realized I had missed something. I wanted to make a second header for additional information about each page, so I added that to each of my pages. You can see the differences below. </p><br>
        <p>About Me Page:</p><br>
        <p><img alt="Day 2 progress of About Me Page" src="Day 2 About.png" width="300"></p><br>
        <p>Contact Me Page:</p><br>
        <p><img alt="Day 2 progress of Contact Page" src="Day 2 Contact.png" width="600"></p><br>
        <p>These edits helped me to make the pages look a little better and break up the navigation pane.</p><br>
        <p>Next, I had to build a table that would let me display some data. I made up some data, breaking down what I did for each section on each day, and a status update on each one!</p><br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Portion</th>
            <th>Day 1</th>
            <th>Day 2</th>
            <th>Final</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>About Me</td>
            <td>Created &amp; Edited</td>
            <td>Final Syntax Changes</td>
            <td>Available Now!</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Contact Us</td>
            <td>Created &amp; Edited</td>
            <td>Final Syntax Changes</td>
            <td>Available Now!</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Home Page</td>
            <td>Created</td>
            <td>Built!</td>
            <td>What you're looking at!</td>
          </tr>
        </table><br>
        <p>Finally, it was time for me to add sections and content and photos to the homepage to complete out the requirements. I will be honest, this does look like a homepage straight from the 90s. I remember seeing websites that look like this when I was a kid. However, I know that in the future I will be able to add some more style components to make the websites look better and more user friendly. But overall, I think that this was a great expereince to get myself used to HTML, and the difference between where content and style exist!</p><br>
