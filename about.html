    <h1>Some information about myself!</h1>

    <p>Hi there! I'm Andrew, and this is my first attempt making a website that includes several pages, lists, and forms! It probably could use some style changes, but I'm hoping my design skills can be further developed later.</p>
    <p>Here are some of my accomplishments since creating this site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used the boilerplate template</li>
      <li>Created and edited the two additional HTML file pages</li>
      <li>Made the entire about page</li>
      <li>Edited the blog posts</li>
      <li>Created the form!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On a more personal note, I am a fifth-year student here at MSU, this is one of my final semesters. I took this course to get myself acquainted with HTML, CSS, and building websites. My goal is to focus my career on cybersecurity, but understanding how the websites and applications we use on daily basis is an important factor in keeping them secure. When you input information into the form here:</p>
    <nav>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <p>you want to make sure no one is stealing your data from you, right? Anyway, it's so cool to mess around and create something of my own!</p>
